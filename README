To install vlad:

1. Drop him somewhere
2. Change the list of email addresses to target
3. Run 'bundle install'
4. Edit crontab.  --solicit is the email requesting responses.  --summary is the email for sending out the responses after they're received.  Picking a good time of day for each is important.  (I like to send out the summary before anyone is awake, but the "solicit" email is trickier to decide)
    0  2 * * * /usr/bin/ruby ~vlad/vlad.rb --solicit
    0 12 * * * /usr/bin/ruby ~vlad/vlad.rb --summary
5. You're done.
